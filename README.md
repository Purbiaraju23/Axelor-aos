# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
